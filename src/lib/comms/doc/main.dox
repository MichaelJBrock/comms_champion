/// @mainpage COMMS Library
/// @tableofcontents
/// @b COMMS is the headers only, platform independent library, 
/// which makes the implementation of a communication
/// protocol to be an easy and relatively quick process. It provides all the necessary
/// types and classes to make the definition of the custom messages, as well as
/// wrapping transport data fields, to be simple declarative statements of type and
/// class definitions. These statements will specify @b WHAT needs to be implemented. 
/// The @b COMMS library internals handle the **HOW** part.
///
/// The internals of the @b COMMS library is mostly template classes which use 
/// multiple meta-programming techniques. As the result, only the functionality,
/// required by the protocol being developed, gets compiled in, providing the best code size and
/// speed performance possible. The down side is that compilation process may
/// take a significant amount of time and consume a lot of memory.
///
/// The @b COMMS library allows having <b>single implementation</b> of the binary 
/// protocol messages, which can be re-compiled and used for any possible application:
/// bare-metal with constrained resources, Linux based embedded systems, even 
/// independent GUI analysis tools.
///
/// The @b COMMS library was specifically developed to be used in **embedded** systems
/// including @b bare-metal ones. It doesn't use exceptions and/or RTTI. It also
/// minimises usage of dynamic memory allocation and provides an ability to exclude
/// it altogether if required, which may be needed when developing @b bare-metal
/// embedded systems. 
/// 
/// Below is a quick tutorial on how to use the library.
/// 
/// @section mainpage_comms_header Headers and Libraries
/// COMMS is a headers only library without any object files to link against. 
/// In order to include the whole functionality of the library please use
/// single include statement:
/// @code
/// #include "comms/comms.h"
/// @endcode
///
/// @section mainpage_error_handling Error Handling
/// The COMMS library is intended to be used in embedded systems (including 
/// bare metal), which means the library cannot use exceptions to report errors.
/// The runtime errors are reported via comms::ErrorStatus return values. All
/// pre- and post-conditions are checked using GASSERT() macro.
/// It is, just like regular standard @b assert() macro, is compiled in if @b NDEBUG symbol
/// is not defined. In case the provided condition doesn't hold true, the macro
/// checks whether custom assertion failure behaviour was registered. If yes,
/// the registered custom assertion failure report is invoked, otherwise the
/// standard failure report used by standard @b assert() macro is used. If COMMS
/// library is used in bare metal environment without standard library, the
/// @b NOSTDLIB symbol should be defined. In this case infinite loop is a default
/// assertion failure report behaviour.
///
/// See @ref page_assert for details on how to define custom assertion failure
/// behaviour.  
///
/// @section mainpage_messages Messages
/// The communication protocols are all about exchanging messages. Every message
/// needs to be serialised into the stream of bytes before being sent on the I/O
/// link. Upon reception of the raw stream of bytes, they need to be
/// deserialised into the message object and the message needs to be recognised
/// and handled appropriately.
/// 
/// The COMMS library provides comms::Message - a basic interface for any 
/// message object. Depending on the options provided to the comms::Message, it
/// provides the following public @b polymorphic interface:
/// @li comms::Message::getId() - Retrieval of the ID of the message.
/// @li comms::Message::read() - Read message data from the stream of raw bytes
/// @li comms::Message::write() - Write message data to the output buffer.
/// @li comms::Message::dispatch() - Dispatch message for handling.
/// @li comms::Message::length() - Get number of bytes required to serialise
///     the message having the current state.
/// @li comms::Message::valid() - Check the validity of the message data.
/// @li comms::Message::refresh() - Bring the message contents into a consistent 
///     state.
///
/// For most cases this interface is enough. However, there may be a need to
/// extend this basic interface. In order to define extended interface, just
/// inherit from comms::Message (while providing appropriate options to it) and
/// add the required extra interface functions.
/// 
/// For example, let's add the retrieval of the message name to the interface:
/// @code
/// #include "comms/comms.h"
///
/// // ID of the messages
/// enum MsgId : std::uint8_t
/// {
///     MsgId_Message1,
///     MsgId_Message2,
///     MsgId_Message3,
///     ...
/// };
/// 
/// class MyHandler; // Forward declaration for class that is responsible to handle the message.
///
/// class MyMessage : public
///     comms::Message<
///         comms::option::BigEndian,        // Use BIG endian for data serialisation.
///         comms::option::MsgIdType<MsgId>, // Use MsgId as message ID type.
///         comms::option::IdInfoInterface,  // Add ID info retrieval interface
///         comms::option::ReadIterator<const std::uint8_t*>, // Use const std::uint8_t* as iterator for reading.
///         comms::option::WriteIterator<std::uint8_t*>, // Use std::uint8_t* as iterator for writing.
///         comms::option::Handler<MyHandler>, // Add support for dispatching message to handler object of MyHandler type.
///         comms::option::ValidCheckInterface, // Add message data validity check to the interface.
///         comms::option::LengthInfoInterface  // Add serialisation length retrieval to the interface.
///     >
/// {
/// public:
///     const char* name() const
///     {
///         return nameImpl(); // Use NVI idiom
///     }
/// 
/// protected:
///     virtual const char* nameImpl() const = 0;
/// };
/// @endcode
/// From now on, @b MyMessage class is the base class for all the custom messages,
/// as well as the common interface for manipulating and handling all the messages,
/// that are going to be implemented. 
///
/// Please note, that comms::Message class receives variable number of
/// template parameters, which are expected to be various options (defined

/// The definition of the custom message class is more or less declarative. The 
/// used types and/or options state what behaviour is expected from the message, 
/// with very little extra code. This makes them implementation of any custom message 
/// class to be quite a simple process. Please pay attention to the following
/// details.
/// @li The comms::option::StaticNumIdImpl option is used to specify actual
///     numeric ID of the message, known at compile time. In case the @b MyMessage
///     interface class was defined to provide polymorphic ID retrieval 
///     functionality (by using comms::option::IdInfoInterface option), the
///     comms::MessageBase class will provide necessary comms::MessageBase::getIdImpl() 
///     virtual member function returning required value.
/// @li The comms::option::MsgType option is used to specify actual message
///     type inheriting from comms::MessageBase. It is required by the latter to
///     properly implement various polymorphic functions, such as 
///     comms::MessageBase::dispatchImpl().
/// @li The comms::option::FieldsImpl option provides all the fields of the
///     message being implemented, bundled into @b std::tuple. When this option
///     is used, the comms::MessageBase class may provide default implementation of
///     read, write, length calculation, and validity check functionalities. If
///     such default implementation is incorrect or incomplete, it is possible to
///     override the default implementation with custom ones, see 
///     @ref page_message_tutorial for details.
/// @li The two fields of the message are given names: @b name1 and @b name2. The
///     COMMS_MSG_FIELDS_ACCESS() macro will create @b FieldIdx enum as well as
///     @b field_* accessor functions for convenient access to the fields having
///     reference to @b Message1 object.
///     @code
///     enum FieldIdx
///     {
///         FieldIdx_name1,
///         FieldIdx_name2,
///         FieldIdx_numOfValues
///     }
///
///     auto field_name1() -> decltype(std::get<FieldIdx_name1>(fields()))
///     {
///         return std::get<FieldIdx_name1>(fields());
///     }
///
///     auto field_name2() -> decltype(std::get<FieldIdx_name2>(fields()))
///     {
///         return std::get<FieldIdx_name2>(fields());
///     }
///     @endcode
///     As the result, the fields of the @b Message1 object may be accessed in
///     two ways. First one is using provided @b FieldIdx values as indices into
///     the fields tuple:
///     @code
///     void handle(Message1& msg)
///     {
///         auto& allFields = msg.field(); // access to fields tuple
///         auto& field1 = std::get<Message1::FieldIdx_name1>(allFields);
///         auto& field2 = std::get<Message1::FieldIdx_name2>(allFields);
///
///         auto value1 = field1.value();
///         auto value2 = field2.value();
///     }
///     @endcode
///     Second one is using @b field_* accessor functions:
///     @code
///     void handle(Message1& msg)
///     {
///        auto& field1 = msg.field_name1();
///        auto& field2 = msg.field_name2();
///
///         auto value1 = field1.value();
///         auto value2 = field2.value();
///     }
///     @endcode
/// 
/// One of the features, that make the implementation of the custom message
/// to be that simple, is the existence of @b fields. Fields are abstractions
/// around value storage classes (such as integral value, floating point value,
/// strings, arrays, etc..), that expose the same predefined interface (read()
/// write(), length(), valid(), ...), which makes it possible to generate code
/// to read, write, calculate length, check validity of the whole message. For
/// example, the length of the message is a summary of length values reported
/// by every data field, that this message contains. Or the read() of the
/// message is an invocation of read() for all the fields. Manually implementing
/// such functionalities may be a tedious and error-prone process. The COMMS
/// library implements them for you (in comms::field namespace), all you need 
/// to do is to use right options the the provided comms::Message and 
/// comms::MessageBase classes. Please refer to @ref page_field_tutorial for  
/// details on the fields, the COMMS library provides.
///
/// The rest of the custom protocol messages can be implemented in a very similar way.
///
/// Also note, that custom message definition class (@b Message1 in the example 
/// above) inherits from comms::MessageBase <MyMessage, ...>, which inherits 
/// from the provided message interface (@b MyMessage), which in turn inherits 
/// from comms::Message <...>. The class hierarchy will look like this:
/// @diafile message_class_hierarchy.dia
/// @n
///
/// @section mainpage_transport_info Transport Info
/// Every message needs to be wrapped in some kind of transport information to
/// insure its safe and correct delivery over I/O link. Let's assume our 
/// custom protocol wraps the serialised messages in the following way:
/// @code
/// SYNC | SIZE | ID | PAYLOAD | CHECKSUM 
/// @endcode    
/// where:
/// @li SYNC - 2 bytes of synchronisation value to indicate beginning of the message, 
///     must be "0xab 0xbc"
/// @li SIZE - 2 bytes, length of remaining data including checksum and not 
///     including SIZE field itself.
/// @li ID - 1 byte, numeric ID of the message.
/// @li PAYLOAD - any number of bytes, serialised message data
/// @li CHECKSUM - 2 bytes, CRC-CCITT value of all bytes starting (and
///     including) from SIZE field and ending after PAYLOAD field.
///
/// To be consistent with previous examples, let's require all the transport 
/// data fields to be serialised using big endian.
///
/// The COMMS library calls transport information "protocol stack" when every
/// field (SYNC, SIZE, ID, PAYLOAD, CHECKSUM) is handled by it's own "layer".
/// The definition of all the layers defined by the COMMS library reside in
/// comms::protocol namespace.
///
/// During read/write operation every layer has to handle the  
/// piece of information, it is responsible for, @b before or @b after performing
/// the same read/write operation on the next layer. The COMMS library implements
/// such functionality by wrapping one layer by the other. The implementation
/// of the example above will look like this:
/// @diafile protocol_stack.dia
///
/// The @b SYNC layer is outermost one. It reads first 2 bytes of available data.
/// If they have the expected value of "0xabcd", then it calls the @b read()
/// member function of the next layer.
/// 
/// Although next information in the raw bytes sequence is the length of the
/// remaining data, the next layer is @b CHECKSUM. This is because it needs to 
/// calculate and verify checksum on all the bytes between @b SIZE and @b PAYLOAD information. 
/// First, the @b CHECKSUM layer records the current location of the data in the
/// input buffer (stores the value of the iterator used for reading). Then it 
/// calls the @b read() member function of the next layer (which is @b SIZE).
/// If the latter reports successful processing of the data when it returns, 
/// the checksum on the processed bytes (between the recorded start of the @b SIZE
/// information and the current location of the still unprocessed data in the 
/// input buffer) is calculated by the @b CHECKSUM layer. After calculation is 
/// complete, the next 2 bytes of the expected checksum is read. If the "calculated"
/// and "expected" values match, then success is reported as the result of the
/// @b CHECKSUM layer read operation.
///  
/// The next layer is responsible to process @b SIZE information. It reads the
/// remaining length value and checks whether there are enough remaining bytes
/// in the input buffer to process rest of the fields.
///
/// The next layer is responsible to process @b ID information. When the @b ID value
/// is read, it uses its internal logic to create and default construct 
/// proper custom message object (based on @b ID information). Once the proper
/// message object is created, the next layer's @b read() member function is called.
///
/// The last layer is responsible to handle the message data (@b PAYLOAD). It
/// just invokes @b read() member function of the message object created in the
/// upper layer (@b ID).
///
/// The write operation is very similar to read. First the @b SYNC layer writes
/// the sync value (0xabcd) to the output buffer, then invokes the write
/// operation of the @b CHECKSUM. The checksum layer first invokes the write
/// operation of the next layer (@b SIZE), then calculates the checksum on the
/// data written by the inner layers and writes the value to the output buffer.
/// The @b SIZE layer reserves the space (2 bytes) for the size information, then
/// invokes the write operation of the next layer (@b ID). Once it returns, the
/// @b SIZE layer calculates number of bytes written, adds 2 (length of the
/// @b CHECKSUM value that will be appended later) to the calculated result and
/// writes the value in the reserved earlier area. The @b ID layer will write the
/// ID of the message being written and invoke the write operation of the next
/// layer (@b PAYLOAD). The @b PAYLOAD layer will just call @b write() member function
/// of the message object being written, which will write the contents of the
/// message to the output buffer.
///   
/// In order to implement such protocol stack with COMMS library, we need to
/// start with innermost layer (@b PAYLOAD) and then wrap them one-by-one until
/// we reach the outermost one (@b SYNC).
/// 
/// The serialised message data (@b PAYLOAD) is handled by comms::protocol::MsgDataLayer:
/// @code
/// typedef comms::protocol::MsgDataLayer<> MyMsgData;
/// @endcode
///
/// The next layer is responsible to handle message ID, it is handled by

/// is created by the @b Protocol @b Stack (see @ref mainpage_transport_info) and held by smart pointer to 
/// @b MyMessage interface. At this moment the proper type of the message is 
/// invisible. The COMMS library provides an easy and efficient way to downcast
/// message object to its appropriate type by using @b polymorphic dispatch call
/// (see comms::Message::dispatch()).
///
/// First of all such call needs to be enabled in the interface by using
/// comms::option::Handler and providing type of the handler as a template
/// parameter:
/// @code
/// class MyMessage : public
///     comms::Message<
///         ...
///         comms::option::Handler<MyHandler>, 
///         ... 
///     >
/// {
///     ...
/// };
/// @endcode
///
/// Second, the actual handler class needs to be defined. It is expected to
/// define @b handle() member function for all types of messages it needs to handle.
/// @code
/// class MyHandler
/// {
/// public:
///     void handle(Message1& msg) {...}
///     void handle(Message2& msg) {...}
///     void handle(Message3& msg) {...}
///
///     // Common handling functions for other types of messages.
///     void handle(MyMessage& msg) {...}
/// }
/// @endcode
/// When providing actual message type using comms::option::MsgType option
/// to comms::MessageBase class, it invokes proper @b handle() member function
/// of the handler class in its comms::MessageBase::dispatchImpl() member
/// function. If appropriate @b handle() member function in the handling class
/// can not be found, the compiler will choose the next best match, which
/// happen to be <b>void handle(MyMessage& msg)</b> one. This function can
/// be used to implement common "don't care" functionality.
/// 
/// To help with the creation of the handler class, the @b COMMS library provides
/// comms::GenericHandler. It has two template parameters. The first one
/// is a type of common interface class (@b MyMessage). The second one is all the messages it
/// should be able to handle bundled in @b std::tuple. As the result 
/// it defines "virtual handle(MyMessage& msg)" function
/// which does nothing, and for every type in the provided tuple of message types
/// defines "virtual handle(MessageType& msg)" function which upcasts the
/// specific type of the message to the interface class @b MyMessage and calls
/// "handle(MyMessage&)" function. For example, the following code
/// @code
/// typedef std::tuple<
///     Message1,
///     Message2,
///     Message3,
///     ...
/// > AllMessages;
///
/// class MyHandler : public comms::GenericHandler<MyMessage, AllMessages>
/// {
/// }
/// @endcode
/// is equivalent to implementing:
/// @code
/// class MyHandler 
/// {
/// public:
///     virtual void handle(Message1& msg) {
///         this->handle(static_cast<MyMessage&>(msg));
///     }
///
///     virtual void handle(Message2& msg) {
///         this->handle(static_cast<MyMessage&>(msg));
///     }
///     ...
///     virtual void handle(MyMessage& msg) {
///         // do nothing
///     }
/// }
/// @endcode
/// By overriding the relevant @b handle() functions in the @b MyHandler class,
/// it is easy to handle only limited number of messages and ignoring all the rest.
/// @code
/// class MyHandler : public comms::GenericHandler<MyMessage, AllMessages>
/// {
/// public:
///     virtual void handle(Message1& msg) override {
///         ... // handle Message1
///     }
///
///     virtual void handle(Message2& msg) override {
///         ... // handle Message2
///     }
///
///     virtual void handle(MyMessage& msg) override {
///         std::cout << "Ignoring message" << std::endl;
///     }
/// }
/// @endcode
/// 
/// Below is the previous example of reading the message from @ref tutorial_polymorphic_read
/// complemented with dispatching created message for handling:
/// @code
/// ProtStack protStack; // Protocol stack defined in previous section
/// MyHandler handler;
/// std::size_t processInput(const std::uint8_t* buf, std::size_t len)
/// {
///     std::size_t consumed = 0U;
///     // Processing loop
///     while (consumed < len) {
///         ... 
///
///         auto es = protStack.read(msgPtr, iter, len - consumed);
///         ...
///
///         if (es == comms::ErrorStatus::Success) {
///             assert(msgPtr); // If read is successful, msgPtr is expected to hold a valid pointer
///             msgPtr->dispatch(handler);
///         }
///
///         ...
///     }
///
///     // Report how many bytes have been consumed from the buffer
///     report consumed;
/// }
/// @endcode
/// Please read @ref page_handler_tutorial for more details and examples.
/// 
/// @section tutorial_polymorphic_write Polymorphic Write
/// The @b COMMS library allows allows implementation of the single writing (serialisation) 
/// function applicable for all the messages. Something like:
/// @code
/// void sendMessage(const MyMessage& msg)
/// {
///     ...
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// In order to allow such polymorhic write, the message interface must define
/// appropriate interface by providing iterator used for writing, and allowing
/// polymorphic retrieval of ID and serialisation length information
/// @code
/// class MyMessage : public
///     comms::Message<
///         ...
///         comms::option::WriteIterator<std::uint8_t*>, // define polymorphic write
///         comms::option::LengthInfoInterface, // allow polymorphic retrieval of length information
///         comms::option::IdInfoInterface, // allow polymorphic retrieval of message ID information
///         ... 
///     >
/// {
///     ...
/// };
/// @endcode
/// 
/// In order to identify storage size required to write
/// the message with all the transport related fields, use "length()" member
/// function of the protocol stack object:
/// @code
/// ProtStack protStack; // Protocol stack defined in one of previous sections
/// void sendMessage(const MyMessage& msg)
/// {
///     std::vector<std::uint8_t> dataToSend; // Data to be sent via I/O link
///
///     auto reqLen = protStack.length(msg); // Number of bytes required to serialise the message;
///     dataToSend.resize(reqLen);
///     auto writeIter = comms::writeIteratorFor<MyMessage>(&dataToSend[0]);
///     auto es = protStack.write(msg, writeIter, dataToSend.size());
///     if (es == comms::ErrorStatus::Success) {
///         ... // Send contents of dataToSend via I/O link
///     }
/// }
/// @endcode
/// Similar to comms::readIteratorFor(), explained in @ref tutorial_polymorphic_read
/// section, the comms::writeIteratorFor() function may be used to initialise and
/// obtain iterator used for writing.
///
/// As another example let's go back and redefine the @b MyMessage interface
/// class to use <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/back_insert_iterator">std::back_insert_iterator</a>  
/// for std::vector<std::uint8_t> to be able to write to the vector without 
/// initial creation of the storage space:
/// @code
/// class MyMessage : public
///     comms::Message<
///         ...
///         comms::option::WriteIterator<std::back_insert_iterator<std::uint8_t> >, 
///     >
/// {
///     ...
/// };
/// @endcode
/// In this case the write functionality may be changed into following:
/// @code
/// ProtStack protStack; // Protocol stack defined in one of previous sections
/// void sendMessage(const MyMessage& msg)
/// {
///     std::vector<std::uint8_t> dataToSend; // Data to be sent via I/O link
///
///     auto writeIter = std::back_inserter(dataToSend);
///     auto es = protStack.write(msg, writeIter, dataToSend.max_size());
///     if (es == comms::ErrorStatus::UpdateRequired) {
///         // The checksum could not be calculated right away, 
///         // create random-access iterator and update the written value
///         auto* updateIter = &dataToSend[0];
///         es = proptStack.update(updateIter, dataToSend.size());
///     }
///
///     if (es == comms::ErrorStatus::Success) {
///         ... // Send contents of dataToSend via I/O link
///     }
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// @section tutorial_write Direct (NON-Polymorphic) Write
/// Sometimes it may be useful to write a common @b non polymorphic code to write
/// a message.
/// @code
/// ProtStack protStack; // Protocol stack defined in one of previous sections
///
/// template <typename TMsg>
/// void sendMessage(const TMsg& msg)
/// {
///     std::vector<std::uint8_t> dataToSend; // Data to be sent via I/O link
///
///     auto writeIter = std::back_inserter(dataToSend);
///     auto es = protStack.write(msg, writeIter, dataToSend.max_size());
///     ...
/// }
/// 
/// Message1 msg1;
/// sendMessage(msg1);
///
/// Message2 msg2;
/// sendMessage(msg2);
/// @endcode
/// In this case the @b COMMS library knows what messages are being written and
/// can invoke @b doWrite non-virtual function (see comms::MessageBase::doWrite())
/// defined by the message itself when serialising message. It eliminates a 
/// necessity of having polymorphic interface with various necessary functions
/// and and can significantly reduce the size of virtual tables
/// of the messages.
